Dr. Xun ZHANG, current Associate professor in ISEP (www.isep.fr), Paris, France. He obtained in October 2009 the Ph.D. degree in the Instrumentation and Microelectronics (IM) Science at the University of Nancy. From 2009 to 2011, he completed a PostDoc in the SCEE laboratory in CentralSup√©lec, France, under the supervision of Pr. Jacques Palicot. During this Postdoc, he applied the auto-reconfigurable management method and control strategies in FPGA for cognitive radio system. He joined the LISITE laboratory in ISEP in 2011 as an associate professor. His current research interests are PHY layer optimization for 5G cellular networks and VLC systems, and VLC-based indoor high accuracy positioning algorithm and tracking algorithm. He has been involved in serval international projects (Horizon H2020 IoRL, EGIDE Franco-Chine, CAIYUANPEI, XUGUANGQI, and Orange foundation RoBo). In 2015 He has launched the Visible light communication activated at ISEP. Currently, his team has one PLC-VLC high data rate demonstration, one VLC based indoor triangulation demonstration platform and one USRP-based Software Defined Radio platform for Visible light communication. Published 60+ scientific papers in internationals journals and conference proceedings and 2 book chapters.  His team has wide exchange program with oversea academic institute like (UK: Brunel university; China: Tsinghua university; HK: Hong Kong university of science and technology) In France, he has a close relation with CEA LETI and Oledcomm who are the leader in VLC market in France. In this project, he will work with Dr. El-Hassane AGLZIM for warehouse demonstration building.
